OPTION 3 - Your own web server:

📁 REQUIRED FILES:
==================
Make sure these 3 files are in the SAME folder:
1. reminder-app.html
2. manifest.json
3. service-worker.js

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:
===================
- PWAs require HTTPS (except for localhost testing)
- For iOS, some PWA features are limited
- The app stores data locally on your device
- Installing the app doesn't mean it updates automatically - you need to reinstall if you update the files

✓ Home screen icon with bell (🔔) on blue background
✓ Standalone mode (no browser UI)
✓ Splash screen when opening
✓ Works offline after first visit
✓ All reminders saved locally

If install option doesn't appear:
1. Make sure you're using HTTPS or localhost
2. Check that manifest.json is loading properly
3. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Clear browser cache and try again
5. Make sure service-worker.js is accessible

For Android Chrome:
- If install banner doesn't show, use manual method
- Make sure Chrome is updated to latest version

For iOS Safari:
- iOS doesn't support install banner
- Always use "Add to Home Screen" method
- Some features like background sync won't work
